# LSX4

LSX4 is an open-source PlayStation 4 emulator application for Android.

LSX4 does not include games, firmware, or other copyrighted system content.

Development also makes use of current-generation large language models (LLMs).

## Current development priorities

- Improving performance in playable games.
- Expanding title compatibility by resolving frontiers and invariants.
- Implementing Mali support and improving performance on Mali devices.
- Increasing the number of playable titles by testing currently untested games.

## Playable games

Tested on devices powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and Snapdragon 8 Gen 5.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Bug reports, compatibility results, performance traces, and focused pull requests are especially useful. Please open an issue before starting a substantial architectural change.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `android-app/` | LSX4 Android application |
| `src/` | LSX4 client-owned native translation and Android runtime sources |
| `externals/` | Native build dependencies |
| `cmake/` | Android native build support |
| `scripts/` | Android dependency build helpers |
| `funnel-arm/` | Android/ARM-adapted emulation layer and authoritative native source profile; desktop distributions and duplicate externals are intentionally absent |
| `assets/` | Project artwork |

## Android application

```sh
cd android-app
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug-only test mode can package a locally owned, decrypted NGS2 module from a
shad4pc `sys_modules` directory:

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug -Pshad4pcNgs2Module=/path/to/shad4pc/user/sys_modules/libSceNgs2.sprx
```

`SHAD4PC_NGS2_MODULE` provides the same path through the environment. The module is
never included in release assets. LSX4 records the hash of a module installed by test
mode and removes only that managed copy when test mode is disabled or a release build
is launched; a module imported by the user is left untouched.

## Native runtime

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
powershell -File scripts/build-ffmpeg-android-pic.ps1
cmake --preset android-arm64-release
cmake --build --preset android-arm64-release
```

The native ownership boundary and optimization strategy are documented in
[`docs/arm_desktop_client_layer_architecture.md`](docs/arm_desktop_client_layer_architecture.md).
